    <h2>Tutoring IT</h2>
    <p>
        Dear Student, if your grades are slipping, it can affect your self confidence. 
        At Rahul Computers we assess your abilities and find out where the problem lies. 
        We also find your strengths, and help you discover your learning style. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Tutoring can be used in the short term to help a student to learn a subject not offered 
        at their college, or simply to extend the achievements of a promising scholar.
    </p>

        At Rahul Computers, our tutoring is a careful and inspired balance of instructions and 
        motivation. All our lessons are designed with you, the learner, in mind. We take your 
        unique abilities and needs into account at every step of the way to ensure that a learning 
        experience at Rahul Computers is an engaging and exciting one.
