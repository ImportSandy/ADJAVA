AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML )

AJAX is a mechanism of exchanging data 
with a server, and updating parts of a 
web page - without reloading the whole page.

AJAX updates a web page synchronously or
asynchronously by exchanging small amounts  
of data with the server behind the scenes. 

AJAX uses a combination of:
 * XMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)
 * JavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)
 * CSS (to style the data)
 * XML/HTML/JSON/PLAIN TEXT (for transferring data)
