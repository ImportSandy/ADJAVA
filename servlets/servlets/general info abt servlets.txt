Servlets
---------
Servlets are java classes that implement
the Servlet interface or extend the
HttpServlet class.

Servlets are used by the web server to
process web client requests and to generate
response.

Variables : Local or Member
--------------------------
Known that to use a class it must be instantaited.

For n users of the web application the web server
will create a single object of the servlets.
so member variables of the servlet class are 
not thread safe.

On users request the web server creates
a new thread and calls the service() ( doGet() 
or doPost() down in hierarchy) method of
the servlet, for processing.

Known that local variables are allocated
(in the stack segment) per call of a method.
So local variables of the service() or doGet() 
or doPost() will be thread safe.

ServletConfig
-------------
ServletConfig object is used to hold configuration 
information about a servlet.
The information may be a connection string, a file name, ...

It is one per servlet.

N users of the same servlet will have the 
same config object.

The config object is created by web server 
(tomcat) after reading the DD file and the 
object is sent to the servlets init method 
which stores the object.
