InetAddress represents an IP address,
which is used by IP, the lower-level 
protocol on which protocols like TCP 
and UDP are built.

A socket is one endpoint of a two-way 
communication link between two programs 
running on the network. 

A datagram socket is the sending or 
receiving point for a packet delivery service. 
Each packet sent or received on a datagram 
socket is individually addressed and routed.

A datagram is an independent, 
self-contained message sent over the network 
whose arrival, arrival time, and content 
are not guaranteed. 

----------------------------------
In computer networking, multicast is the 
delivery of a message or information to 
a group of destination computers simultaneously 
in a single transmission from the source 
creating copies automatically if the 
topology of the network requires it.


A MulticastSocket is useful for sending
and receiving IP multicast packets. 

A MulticastSocket is a (UDP like) DatagramSocket, 
with additional capabilities for joining 
"groups" of multicast hosts on the network. 

A multicast group is specified by a 
class D IP address and by a standard
UDP port number. 
Class D IP addresses are in the range 
224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, inclusive. 

The address 224.0.0.0 is reserved and 
should not be used.
